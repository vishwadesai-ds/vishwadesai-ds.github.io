# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**, designed and developed to showcase my learning journey, projects, skills, and certifications in **Data Science, Analytics, and Web Development**.

The portfolio is built as a **single-page application (SPA-style)** for smoother navigation and better user experience.

-----------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Tech Stack Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and content
- **CSS3** – Custom styling & responsive layout
- **Bootstrap 5** – Grid system, components, responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** –  
  - Dynamic navigation behavior  
  - Active tab highlighting  
  - Smooth interactions  
  - Form handling logic  

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> GitHub’s language statistics show mostly HTML because all JavaScript and Bootstrap logic is embedded directly inside the single HTML file using `<script>` and `<style>` tags.

-----------------------------------------------------

## ✨ Key Features

- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Smooth navigation without page reloads
- Modular sections:
  - About
  - Skills
  - Projects
  - Kaggle Notebooks
  - Certifications
  - Contact
- Interactive UI elements with hover effects
- Clean, minimal, professional theme

-----------------------------------------------------

## 📂 Project Structure

- index.html ← All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combined
- img/ icons/ fonts/ certificates/ resume/ js/ css/ <- folders

-----------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Why Single File?

First it was well structure multipage website but I noticed blinking reloading while changing tabs so,

I intentionally converted the site into a **single HTML file** to:
- Avoid page reload flickering
- Improve perceived performance
- Simplify deployment on GitHub Pages
- Keep everything easy to maintain and portable
